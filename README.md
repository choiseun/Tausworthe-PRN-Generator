# Tausworthe-PRN-Generator
• Developed a robust Tausworthe pseudo-random number generator in R from scratch and verified the generator’s adherence to the uniform distribution through rigorous statistical tests. <br/>
• Explored adjacent PRN patterns and applied transformative techniques to convert uniform variables to standard normal variables.
