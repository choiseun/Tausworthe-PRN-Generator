# Tausworthe-PRN-Generator
Developed a robust Tausworthe pseudo-random number generator in R from scratch and verified the generatorâ€™s adherence to the uniform distribution through rigorous statistical tests. Explored adjacent PRN patterns and applied transformative techniques to convert uniform variables to standard normal variables.
