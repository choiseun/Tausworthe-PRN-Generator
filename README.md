### Summary

In this project, I built a successful implementation of the Tausworthe pseudo-random number generator, performed multiple statistical tests to verify that the generator produces PRNs that are approximately i.i.d. Uniform(0,1), plotted adjacent PRNs on the unit square to investigate their pattern, and transformed the Uniform(0,1) variables to Normal(0,1) variables.
